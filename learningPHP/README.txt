Downloaded XAMPP to my C drive

Run from C:/xamppp/xampp-controll.exe (run as administrator)

Code is placed in C/xampp/htdocs
htdocs is the webroot
index.php can be reached at http://localhost/

Added password to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
And added same password to C/xampp/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php

Created a folder in htdocs called phpsandbox
All files are created there and reached via http://localhost/phpsandbox/filename
Then copied here and uploaded to github
